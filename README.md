# Simas Pocevicius - Data Analyst portfolio
## About
My name is Simas. I'm on track to finish my data analysis courses. I used to work in various jobs and I've become passionate about using data to discover meaningful insights. As a beginning data professional, I am ready to put my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science.I take enthusiasm from my ability to think critically and solve problems, in addition to my technical skills, which I gained from my previous jobs. I am able to analyse data strategically and find the data's key problems and prospects. During my studies I improved my data-working skills and grew my ability in recognising patterns and trends during my studies. I also gained experience in data analytics techniques such as dashboard building, report, blueprint writing, statistics, and critical thinking. 

I like to experiment with new tools and methods for data analysis in during my spare time, and I am constantly seeking for ways to increase my knowledge and abilities.I'm motivated by the excitement of finding new insights and the pride of utilising data to tackle tricky challenges, whether I'm working alone or in a team.

## Study projects
### [Electric energy demand data transformation, analysis and visualization](https://github.com/SimasPo/Electric-energy-demand-analysis-and-visualization)
**Full project:** 

**Goal:** The objective of this project is to create a neatly formatted version of the data, show summaries of the demand over time, show the effect of weather on demand, show the impact of holidays on demand.

**Description:** In the dataset were date, demand, PRP, weather characteristics. Data cleaning and processing are completed. VLOOKUP, MAXIFS TEXT, INDEX, MATCH function usage. Energy demand over time, effect of weather on demand, demand by different time slices graphs with insights. Summarization of the extremes in demand and revenue.

**Skills:** Data analysis, data visualization, data cleaning and organization

**Tools:** Excel

**Results:** As a result we have clean, well organised tables and clear insights from graphs.

**Deliverables** [Energy Demand .xlsx](https://github.com/SimasPo/Hello-world/blob/main/EnergyDemand%20worksheet.xlsx)

### [Dashboard meeting business requrements](https://github.com/SimasPo/assess-te-quality-of-a-dataset-for-a-public-service-agency)
**Full project:**

**Goal:** To standardize the monitoring of various projects within the company.

**Description:** The project focused on analysing and visualizating data to keep track of how projects are doing to measure current and future performance. The dataset included Project ID, Project Type, country, phase, start date, planed and actual costs, duration, deliverables. The project involved loading the data, creating a map and table to show which projects are dunning/have run in which countries, identifying countries over cost, duration and delivering, showing financial performance over time and project duration. Blueprint. 

**Skills:** Data exploration, data analysis, data visualization

**Tools:** Tableau

**Results:** Created dashboard blueprint and completed dashboard that: allows the user to identify themselves, based on that identity, presents the appropriate data and visualizations, shows all of the KPIs in the blueprint.

**Deliverables** [Dashboard blueprint .docx](https://github.com/SimasPo/Hello-world/blob/main/Dashboard_Blueprint.docx), [Tableau Dashboard](https://github.com/SimasPo/Hello-world/blob/main/Tableau)

### [Assess the Quality of a Dataset for a Public Service Agency](https://github.com/SimasPo/assess-te-quality-of-a-dataset-for-a-public-service-agency)
**Full project:**

**Goal:** To evaluate the data for projects and determine the extent to which this is possible.

**Description:** The Parks and Open Spaces Office within the Council have identified some data that they think will support upcoming projects as part of the council’s new data initiative. The data includes a list of trees in the borough. The team are unsure as to whether the data they have can be used to deliver these projects. My job is to evaluate the data and determine the extent to which this is possible. Project includes: Documentation of the Data Sources, 
Loading the Data and Performing Initial Exploration, Further Inspection of the Data Sets, Identifying Missing Values, Identifying Outliers in the Trees Dimensions, Identifying Duplicates in the Data Set, Identifying Geolocation Issues, Identifying Unmatched Data, Reporting back on me process.

**Skills:** Identify data sources and the risks, challenges to combination. Undertake customer requirements analysis and implement findings in planning and outputs. Identify and escalate quality risks in data analysis with suggested mitigation/resolutions. Apply principles of data classification within data analysis activity. Describe principles of data, including open, public, administrative and research data.

**Tools:** Google Colab, Pandas

**Results:** The data source list to help to understand where the data comes from and if there are any problems or limitations with its usage. Understanding of the types of variables I am dealing with, the overall size of the data sets and the data types of the columns. Determined which columns have missing values and how big the problem is. Checked if there are any outliers in the tree heights, spreads or diameters and how many duplicate trees there is. List of trees that are not actually in the desired area. Identified mismatches between the different data set.
